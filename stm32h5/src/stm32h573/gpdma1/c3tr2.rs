= 10). The monitoring of this trigger is kept active during the triggered and uncompleted (data or link) transfer; and if a new trigger is detected then, this hit is internally memorized to grant the next transfer, as long as the defined rising or falling edge is not modified, and the TRIGSEL\\[5:0\\]
is not modified, and the channel is enabled. Transferring a next LLIn+1 that updates the GPDMA_CxTR2 with a new value for any of TRIGSEL\\[5:0\\]
or TRIGPOL\\[1:0\\], resets the monitoring, trashing the memorized hit of the formerly defined LLIn trigger. After a first new trigger hitn+1 is memorized, if another second trigger hitn+2 is detected and if the hitn triggered transfer is still not completed, hitn+2 is lost and not memorized.memorized. A trigger overrun flag is reported (GPDMA_CxSR.TOF =1 ), and an interrupt is generated if enabled (GPDMA_CxCR.TOIE = 1). The channel is not automatically disabled by hardware due to a trigger overrun. Note: When the source block size is not a multiple of the source burst size and is a multiple of the source data width, then the last programmed source burst is not completed and is internally shorten to match the block size. In this case, if TRIGM\\[1:0\\]
= 11 and (SWREQ =1 or (SWREQ = 0 and DREQ =0 )), the shortened burst transfer (by singles or/and by bursts of lower length) is conditioned once by the trigger. When the programmed destination burst is internally shortened by singles or/and by bursts of lower length (versus FIFO size, versus block size, 1-Kbyte boundary address crossing): if the trigger is conditioning the programmed destination burst (if TRIGM\\[1:0\\]
= 11 and SWREQ = 0 and DREQ = 1), this shortened destination burst transfer is conditioned once by the trigger."]
